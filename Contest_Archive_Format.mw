This page describes a draft archivel format for a contest. It is developed in parallel with the [[Contest API]]. It might very well end up being very similar to the CDP which has been suggested to use for this, but which have a slightly different purpose...

== Introduction ==

There are several reasons that contest information will be stored on disk, including:
* As configuration used to initialize a CCS
* As an archive of what happened in a contest
* As an archive for replaying a contest, either for testing contest tools or for teams to compete against live data
* As a base for offline analysis

This standard lays out the relative location and format of each type of contest-related information when reading or writing to disk. The top level structure is based on the [[Contest API]] structure, and a dump of the output from that API is one way to store the data. That said, the archive format allows for any format whose documentation has been registered with the ICPC. The sections below lists all currently known (and thus accepted) formats.

== Structure ==

The Contest Archive consists of a single directory (possibly ZIP compressed) with a metadata file ('''archive.yaml''') and at most a single entry for each of the types of data ('''config''', '''problems''', '''registration''',  '''activity''', '''results''', '''events'''). An entry is either a directory with the same name as the type of data, or a file with same base name as the type of data and any file extension.

=== Metadata ===

Archive metadata is stored in a YAML file called '''archive.yaml''' with the following keys:

{| class="wikitable"
! Key !! Description
|-
| created-by || Name of system creating this archive
|-
| archive || ID of format used for content types not listed in archive.yaml
|-
| config || ID of format used for '''config'''
|-
| problems || ID of format used for '''problems'''
|-
| registration || ID of format used for '''registration'''
|-
| activity || ID of format used for '''activity'''
|-
| results || ID of format used for '''results'''
|-
| events || ID of format used for '''events'''
|}

Only '''created-by''' is always required, but if any of content type is not listed then '''archive''' must be specified.

== Contest API archive formats ==

'''NB!''': This section should not be in this document, and is only included here while WIP. It should either be its own document, or be added to the [[Contest API]] document. Every subsection defines the on disk format '''contest-api''' for a type of data.

=== General principle ===

Endpoints are stored in a single <endpoint>.json file containing the full list of objects. This file is identical to the API call to /<endpoint>. If there are file references in the JSON file these are stored in a subfolder per object, using the object ID as the folder name.

 <endpoint>/<endpoint>.json
 <endpoint>/<id>/<other files>

=== Config ===

A directory, '''config''', containing:

* a JSON file (contest.json) for the /contests/<id> endpoint 
* a JSON file (judgement-types.json) for the /contests/<id>/judgement-types endpoint
* a JSON file (languages.json) for the /contests/<id>/languages endpoint
* system.yaml defined in the [[Contest_Control_System_Requirements#system.yaml | CCSR]].
* the contest banner(s), from the banner element of /contests/<id>, if available.
* the contest logo(s), from the logo element of /contests/<id>, if available.
