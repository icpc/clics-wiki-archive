====Format====

Each JSON output is created is an JSON array with zero or 
more JSON members.  The output will be in a single long JSON
string.

Sample JSON if no teams defined
 []

Each JSON Member is composed of a team member with optional problem members
for example.  This example is formatted in order to better show the example,
the actual JSON will be a single line of JSON.

  [ {"id":"1","name":"University of Brevia","group":"Pangea"
 	,"B":{"a":1,"t":20,"s":"solved"}
 	,"D":{"a":1,"t":66,"s":"first"}
 	,"E":{"a":1,"t":112,"s":"solved"}
 	,"F":{"a":3,"s":"tried"}
 	,"L":{"a":3,"t":152,"s":"solved"}},
  {"id":"2","name":"University of Fondu","group":"North America"
 	,"B":{"a":1,"t":10,"s":"first"}
 	,"D":{"a":1,"t":68,"s":"solved"}
 	,"E":{"a":1,"t":122,"s":"solved"}
 	,"F":{"a":2,"s":"tried"}
 	,"L":{"a":3,"t":192,"s":"solved"}}
 ]

This same JSON example will be output as a single line, for example:
 [{"id":"1","name":"University of Brevia","group":"Pangea","B":{"a":1,"t":20,"s":"solved"},"D":{"a":1,"t":66,"s":"first"},"E":{"a":1,"t":112,"s":"solved"},"F":{"a":3,"s":"tried"},"L":{"a":3,"t":152,"s":"solved"}},{"id":"2","name":"University of Fondu","group":"North America","B":{"a":1,"t":10,"s":"first"},"D":{"a":1,"t":68,"s":"solved"},"E":{"a":1,"t":122,"s":"solved"},"F":{"a":2,"s":"tried"},"L":{"a":3,"t":192,"s":"solved"}}]

====General Format for problem members====

 {"id":"<team_id>","rank":<Rank>,"solved":<problems_solved>,"score":<team_score>"name":"<University_name>","group":"<Group_name>"
 	,"<Problem_letter>":{"a":<Attempts>,"p":<Pending>,"t":<Elapsed_time>,"s":"<Results_phase>"}},
