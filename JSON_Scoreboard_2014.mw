===Scoreboard JSON File===

====Format====

Each JSON output is created is an JSON array with zero or 
more JSON objects. Each object in the array corresponds to a scoreboard row.  The output will be in a single long JSON
string.

Sample JSON if no teams defined
 []

Each row object includes information about the team, the problems they have submitted on and scoring information.  The rows are ordered by the teams' positions according to the ICPC WF scoring rules.
This example is formatted in order to better show the example,
the actual JSON does not need to include line breaks. The example is truncated and shows just the top two teams.

  [ {"id":"61","rank":1,"solved":9,"score":1170,"name":"St. Petersburg State University of IT, Mechanics and Optics","group":"Europe",
        "B":{"a":1,"t":18,"s":"solved"},
        "C":{"a":1,"t":79,"s":"solved"},
        "D":{"a":2,"t":42,"s":"solved"},
        "E":{"a":2,"t":165,"s":"solved"},
        "F":{"a":2,"t":142,"s":"first"},
        "G":{"a":1,"t":208,"s":"solved"},
        "I":{"a":2,"t":125,"s":"solved"},
        "K":{"a":1,"t":49,"s":"solved"},
        "L":{"a":1,"t":262,"s":"solved"}},
    {"id":"103","rank":2,"solved":9,"score":1547,"name":"University of Warsaw","group":"Europe",
        "A":{"a":5,"t":291,"s":"solved"},
        "B":{"a":1,"t":32,"s":"solved"},
        "C":{"a":2,"t":60,"s":"solved"},
        "D":{"a":1,"t":19,"s":"solved"},
        "E":{"a":1,"t":187,"s":"solved"},
        "F":{"a":1,"s":"tried"},
        "G":{"a":3,"t":234,"s":"solved"},
        "I":{"a":2,"t":147,"s":"solved"},
        "K":{"a":5,"t":128,"s":"solved"},
        "L":{"a":3,"t":169,"s":"solved"}},
    ....
  ]

====General Format for row objects====
The format of a scoreboard row object is

 {"id":"<team_id>","rank":<Rank>,"solved":<problems_solved>,"score":<team_score>"name":"<University_name>","group":"<Group_name>"
 	(,"<Problem_letter>":{"a":<Attempts>(,"p":<Pending>)?(,"t":<Elapsed_time>)?,"s":"<Results_phase>"})*}

where (...)* implies zero or more occurances and (...)? implies zero or one occurance.
