== Introduction ==

This page documents the version 1.3 release of the CDS, to be used at the 2018 World Finals. The primary change from previous years is support of the new [https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php/Draft_CCS_REST_interface REST interface]. All services are still available, but several have been removed from this page since they are now included as part of the spec. If you find something 'missing' here, please check the REST interface documentation first. If there is a previous endpoint that would be very hard for you to switch to the new interface in time for 2018 finals please ping Tim to discuss whether we can leave the old interface in place for one year.

The Contest Data Server (or CDS) is a one-stop shop for external clients to obtain all onsite contest related information. This document contains information on the services (URLs) that are available from the CDS, what content is returned, and links to specs for the format of some files.

It's best to think of the CDS as an aggregator and gate keeper. It provides a single source for information and controls access, but most of the data is provided by sources on the blue network, including the Contest Control System and data extracted from the Baylor CMS. 

=== Implementation Notes ===

* URLs below are in the format "http://cds/xyz". The exact hostname or IP address for 'cds' will be provided once the network is setup onsite; contest machines configured by sysops will be able to lookup this hostname.
* Some of the URLs contain a year (e.g. http://cds/2015/xyz") to indicate that these are temporary formats that will almost definitely change over the following year.
* Invalid URLs, parameters (e.g. teamNum=500), or missing images will return the standard HTTP status codes 404. Ditto for authentication and code 403.

== Access & Authentication ==

Requests for access to the CDS must be made through the world finals technical director (John Clevenger) and must include contact information for during the finals. Many of the services will contain private information, so each client will be given a unique user id & password to connect to the CDS. Access to all secure services is via HTTPS. (HTTP access will be redirected)

To simplify security, access is provided via roles that each have access to different content. The defined roles are as follows:

* Public - Access only to data/services that are public contest info and can be shared externally at any time. These few services require no authentication.
* Authorized - Authorized access to public data/services that can be shared externally at any time.
* Analyst - Authorized + access to team backups and submission source.
* Balloon - Authorized + access to runs within the last hour if the team has less than 3 balloons.
* Blue - Full access to all data/services, typically someone within the contest network. (e.g. results during final hour)
* Admin - Full access + control authority.

Access builds somewhat logically, e.g. Blue users have access to everything that Analysts & Balloon have. The services below are marked with what access role is required.

== Services ==

The following section describes all of the services that are available through the CDS.

=== REST Interface ===

 <nowiki>https://cds/contest</nowiki>
''Access: Authorized''

This is the root of the new contest REST interface, e.g. /contest will return information about the current contest.

Additions/extensions to the spec:
*TBD*. Once the spec finalizes we will document here any additional capability that the CDS will provide above the requirements but using the same interface, e.g. team members.

=== Images ===

==== Team University Logos ====
Provided through REST interface now.

==== Team Photos ====
Provided through REST interface now.

==== Team Overlay Images ====
 Provided through REST interface now.

Returns a full HD (1920x1080) png containing the team logo and name, for use as an overlay graphic.

The logo is in a rectangle that is 230x230 pixels, with the upper left corner of the rectangle located at 95 pixels from the left side and 795 pixels down from the top of the PNG image. The team name is in the ICPC font (Helvetica) in a rectangle that is 1275x230 pixels (width x height), with the upper left corner of the rectangle at 370 pixels from the left side and 795 pixels down from the top of the PNG image. Either graphic may or may not fill its entire rectangle.

A sample overlay file is provided here: [[Media:28.png]].

=== Data Feeds ===

==== Contest Control System Event Feed ====
 <nowiki>https://cds/events</nowiki>
''Access: Authorized''

Returns the 2016 event feed as generated by the CCS: [[Event Feed 2016]].

Clients without Blue access rights will receive a filtered event feed not containing submission judgments from the final hour.

==== Contest Feed Proposal ====
Provided through REST interface now.

==== JSON Scoreboard ====
Provided through REST interface now.

==== Optimistic JSON Scoreboard ====
 <nowiki>https://cds/optimisticScoreboard</nowiki>
''Access: Authorized''

Returns a JSON scoreboard as defined here: [[JSON Scoreboard 2016]]

The optimistic scoreboard assumes that the last submission made on any problem during the freeze is solved. e.g. if a team has submitted three times after the scoreboard freeze, this scoreboard will assume that the first two were wrong answers and the third was correct.

This scoreboard may not be shown publicly unless it is clearly labelled as a possible projection! In reality the first submission might have been correct, or the third may still not be solved.

==== Contest RSS Feed (Draft) ====
 <nowiki>https://cds/rss</nowiki>
''Access: Authorized''

Returns an RSS feed of solved submissions, e.g. "University of X solved problem Y!"

Clients without sufficient access rights will received a filtered RSS feed that does not contain submission judgments from the final hour.

=== Video ===

Provided through REST interface now.

Returns a full HD (1920x1080) video of the given team, typically taken during registration.

==== Channels ====

Channels are a paired camera & screen video that can be changed on demand. It allows a client to use a fixed url for the duration of the contest, and for another user (typically an analyst) to switch which team the client is watching.

 <nowiki>http://cds/video/camera/channel/[channelNum]</nowiki>
 <nowiki>http://cds/video/screen/channel/[channelNum]</nowiki>
''Access: Public''

Returns video streams of the given channel, with content and format identical to the team webcam and desktop streams above.

 <nowiki>https://cds/video/channel/[channelNum]/[teamNum]</nowiki>
''Access: Analyst''

Changes the given channel to output from the given team.

==== Reaction Videos ====
Provided through REST interface now.
