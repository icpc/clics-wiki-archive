===Authentication===

:'''Comment:''' Add a description of the login/password for this feed [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 17:14, 20 February 2011 (CET)

:'''Comment:''' Add a description of return data if authentication fails [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 17:14, 20 February 2011 (CET)

===Accessing the feed===

Connect to port 4713 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed.

Connect to port 4714 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you, with the exception that no judgement information will be sent for runs submitted during the last hour. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed (but you will still not get judgements for runs submitted the last hour).

:'''Comment:''' Should the cutoff time (1 hour) be configurable?  [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 02:09, 5 February 2011 (CET)

:'''Comment:''' Should a (filter) request be made to the CCS about which filtered event feed rather than using a different port number? [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 02:09, 5 February 2011 (CET)

== File format ==
The event feed is an XML document within the root element <tt><contest></tt>.

All events are separate elements at the top level.

''Notes''
# Most elements are identified by an id. 
# Submission events have a time element in decimal seconds relative to the contest start when it was submitted.
# Timestamped events all have a timestamp element in decimal seconds.
# Timestamped time attributes are identical to the timestamp element
# The <finalized> element is followed by a </contest> tag
