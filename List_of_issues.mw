# Problem Format - add validator option "newline_sensitive"
# Define Standard Scoreboard Disclaimer phrases for scoreboard on freeze and end of contest, see comment in [[Contest_Control_System#Freezing_the_Scoreboard|Freezing the Scoreboard]]
# Flesh out problem format description
## Loading/verifying the Problem ([[Problem format]]) needs to be obvious, it is too subtle in the document.
# Should teams be able to see current state of a problem?
# Automatic invocation of judging needs to be done on machines set aside for judging so that auto-judging runs on auto-judging the machines and apply an algorithm to avoid machine starvation
# <s>Update [[Event Feed]] move Balloon Notification into [[Event Feed]] - Tim</s>
# Standardized output messages for prohibited operations, see [[Test_Harness#Testing_Prohibited_Operations]]
# Add requirement for built-in validator/diff into CCS.  If no custom validator specified, defaults to this built-in validator.
#* Such a requirement already exists -- Per.
# Specify which version of YAML should be used/is expected.
