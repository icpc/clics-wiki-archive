'''List of CLICCS items requiring resolution'''

# Contest Configuration section needs to be reorganized  - John 
# Output validator 
# Look through that terminology is used consistently
# Defining the schedule for releasing the CCS Standard
# Go through all emails, check for items
# Output validator standard
# Go through all comments in the document.
# A better name for '''Judging Error''' (makes it sound like the CCS/validator was not tested)
# Defining the procedure for verifying candidate CCS systems (i.e., scope and process for a "Test Harness")
# Flesh out problem format description
# Write [[Input validator]] standard (stub created)
# Create a more complete standardized format of the Output Validator Feedback file
# Automatic invocation of judging needs to be done on machines set aside for judging so that auto-judging runs on auto-judging the machines and apply an algorithm to avoid machine starvation
# Changes in .tsv content and values, send note to Jeff and Mikael - Doug
# Define Standard Scoreboard Disclaimer phrases for scoreboard on freeze and end of contest, see comment in [[Contest_Control_System#Freezing_the_Scoreboard|Freezing the Scoreboard]]
# Update [[Event Feed]] including moving Balloon Notification into [[Event Feed]] - Tim
# Standardized output messages for prohibited operations, see [[Test_Harness#Testing_Prohibited_Operations]]
# Loading/verifying the Problem ([[Problem format]]) needs to be obvious, it is too subtle in the document.
# Input Validator Standard
# Add requirement for built-in validator/diff into CCS.  If no custom validator specified, defaults to this built-in validator.
# Specify which version of YAML should be used/is expected.
# Validators read from stdin?
# In CCS, write out of contest.yaml as a required operation (Doug to double check that it is in the CCS already)
