This page describes the event feed format that will be used at WF 2011

== Getting the feed ==

Connect to port 4713 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed.

Connect to port 4714 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you, with the exception that no judgement information will be sent for runs submitted during the last hour. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed (but you will still not get judgements for runs submitted the last hour).

== File format ==
The event feed is structured as an xml document within the root element <contest>.

All events are separate elements at the top level.

Event types are:

;info: contest information and updates
;language: submission language information
;region: super region information
;judgement: judgement information
;problem: problem information
;team: team information
;clar: submitted clarification information and updates
;run: submitted run information and updates
;testcase: judgement of individual test cases for a run

Most elements are identified by an id. Timestamped events all have a timestamp element in decimal seconds.
Submission events have a time element in decimal seconds relative to the contest start when it was submitted.

Events have time attributes identical to the timestamp element.

Sample events with inner element descriptions:

=== <info> ===

 <info>
 <length>05:00:00</length>
 <penalty>20</penalty>
 <started>False</started>
 <starttime>1265335138.26</starttime>

 </info>

;length: Length of contest in HH:MM:SS format.
;penalty: Penalty time in minutes.
;started: Started flag.
;starttime: Starttime as a timestamp in decimal seconds.

==Balloon notification feed==

:'''Comment:''' This should be moved into its own article like [[Event Feed]] [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 18:48, 13 April 2011 (CEST)

Like the [[Event Feed]], the balloon notifications are provided as an XML document that can be processed as a stream using e.g., a SAX parser.

A notification should be sent the first time a team solves a particular problem. If a previously accepted run is rejected due to rejudging, no notification is sent, nor is a notification sent if and when the team subsequently solves the problem.

===Example===
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
 <notifications>
   <notification>
     <team-id>34</team-id>
     <team>U Waterloo</team>
     <time>132.04213</time>
     <timestamp>1298733213.102</timestamp>
     <nr>214</nr>
     <balloon>
       <problem-id>B</problem-id>
       <problem>Bulls and bears</problem>
       <rgb>ff0000</rgb>
       <color>Red</color>
     </balloon>
     <first-by-team>true</first-by-team>
     <balloons>
       <!-- balloons that team already has -->
       <balloon>
         <problem-id>D</problem-id>
         <problem>Down the hill</problem>
         <rgb>33cc00</rgb>
         <color>Green</color>
       </balloon>
       <balloon>
         <problem-id>F</problem-id>
         <problem>Failing to make the grade</problem>
         <rgb>ffff00</rgb>
         <color>Yellow</color>
       </balloon>
     </balloons>
   </notification>
   <!-- ...more notifications -->
 </notifications>

===Elements===

;nr: id of notification, sequential starting at 1 (int)
;balloon : see below
;first-in-contest: required only when true (bool)
;first-for-problem: required only when true (bool)
;first-by-team: required only when true (bool)
;balloon: list of ballons team already should have

:'''Comment:''' Standardize types and constants, put into their own section in article [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 18:56, 13 April 2011 (CEST)
:Examples for discussion<br>
::bool, values: "true", "false"  (lower case strings) ?<br> 
::character in problem-id: a single upper case letter<br>
::rgb: hex is an integer<br>

===Access to notifications===

:'''Comment:''' TODO. Connect to some port, authenticate in some way, get summary somehow. [[User:Migo|Mikael Goldmann]]

:'''Comment:''' Is the program that consumes the notifications responsible for tracking which have been send and which have not? [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 17:06, 20 February 2011 (CET)
