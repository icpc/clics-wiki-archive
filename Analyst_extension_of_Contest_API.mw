'''This is an early draft of extensions to the [[Contest API]] to support analyst data'''

Section names match those in [[Contest API]]. New sections (i.e. sections that do not appear in parent document) should simply be added. Existing but empty sections are only there for structure (i.e. to properly place a subsection). If edits are needed in an existing section there will be a comment within square brackets ([, ]) describing the changes needed.
