The ''Event Feed'' is an externally-accessible XML feed of contest data supplied by a [[CCS|Contest Control System]]. The event feed is the primary way that 'external' clients can get the state of a running contest. 

== Getting the feed ==

Connect to port 4713 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed.

Connect to port 4714 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you, with the exception that no judgement information will be sent for runs submitted during the last hour. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed (but you will still not get judgements for runs submitted the last hour).

== File format ==

The event feed is an XML document within the root element <tt><contest></tt>. 

Within the contest element are a number of configuration items and events, each of which are separate top-level elements:

Event types & tags:
{| class="wikitable"
! Element !! Contains !! Type
|-
|info|| contest information and updates || Configuration
|-
|language|| submission language information || Configuration
|-
|region|| superregion information || Configuration
|-
|judgement|| judgement information || Configuration
|-
|problem|| problem information || Configuration
|-
|team|| team information || Configuration
|-
|clar|| clarifications || Event
|-
|run|| submitted run and updates || Event
|-
|testcase|| judgement of individual input file for a run || Event
|-
|finalized|| the contest standings/medals are assigned, contest is over || Event
|-
|}

Other elements beyond what is documented here may also be sent, these should be ignored.

Notes
# All child-elements are required unless otherwise documented.
# All contest-time elements are in decimal seconds.
# All timestamp elements are in decimal seconds since the Unix epoch, Jan 1st, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
