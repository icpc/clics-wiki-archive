The ''Event Feed'' is an externally-accessible XML feed of contest data supplied by a [[CCS|Contest Control System]]. The event feed is the primary way that external clients can get the state of a running contest. 

== Getting the feed ==

Connect to port 4713 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed.

Connect to port 4714 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you, with the exception that no judgement information will be sent for runs submitted during the last hour. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed (but you will still not get judgements for runs submitted the last hour).

== Information updates ==

CCSs will typically send all configuration elements, followed by a set of events.

Under some circumstances configuration or event elements may be resent. These circumstances include but are not limited to:
* Changing some contest configuration, such as the start time
* Rejudgements of runs
* Fixing typos in names

Under some circumstances the connection may be dropped. These circumstances include but are not limited to:
* Removal (or reinsertion) of a time interval

When reconnecting, all elements will 

If a client reconnects to the event feed it will get all configuration and events from the beginning. The client cannot assume that it will see the exact same elements after a reconnect and should discard any state constructed from the event feed prior to reconnecting.

== Top level structure ==

The event feed is an XML document within the root element <tt><contest></tt>. 

Within the contest element are a number of configuration items and events, each of which are separate top-level elements:

Event types & tags:
{| class="wikitable"
! Element !! Contains !! Type
|-
|info|| contest information and updates || Configuration
|-
|language|| submission language information || Configuration
|-
|region|| superregion information || Configuration
|-
|judgement|| judgement information || Configuration
|-
|problem|| problem information || Configuration
|-
|team|| team information || Configuration
|-
|clar-request|| clarification request || Event
|-
|clar-response|| clarification (answers to clarification requests) or broadcast messages|| Event
|-
|submission|| submission from a team || Event
|-
|submission-judgement|| result of submission from a team || Event
|-
|run|| judgement of individual input file for a run || Event
|-
|finalized|| the contest standings/medals are assigned, contest is over || Event
|-
|}

Other elements beyond what is documented here may also be sent, these should be ignored. This applies both at the top level and within the top-level elements.

Notes
# All child-elements are required unless otherwise documented.
# All contest-time elements are in decimal seconds.
# All timestamp elements are in decimal seconds since the Unix epoch, Jan 1st, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

== Configuration elements ==

Configuration elements will be sent in the beginning of the feed. The exception to this rule is if the data in a configuration element is changed in which case it will be resent

=== Info ===

Format:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name !! Description !! Type
|-
|title || Contest title || xsd:string
|-
|length || Length of contest || xsd:string HH:MM:SS

Any new info element overrides earlier elements.

   <length>05:00:00</length>
   <scoreboard-freeze-length>01:00:00</scoreboard-freeze-length>

   <start-time>1265335138.26</start-time>
 </info>

|}

A problem element is identified by it's label. If a problem element with the same label as an earlier element arrives the latter overrides the former.

Example:

A team element is identified by it's team number. If a team element with the same team number as an earlier element arrives the latter overwrites the former.
