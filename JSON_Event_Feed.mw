This page describes a draft for a JSON event feed.

== Getting the feed ==

'''TODO'''

== Feed format ==

The feed is served as [http://specs.okfnlabs.org/ndjson/ Newline delimited JSON], with every event as it's own JSON object.

The general format for events is:
 {"event": "<event type>", "id": "<event id>", "timestamp": "<timestamp>", "data": { <event data> }}

Every event has a corresponding [[Draft_CCS_REST_interface | REST interface]] endpoint. The "data" key will, when available, contain exactly what would be returned when calling the corresponding REST endpoint with the given "id".
