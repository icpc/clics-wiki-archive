This page describes the event feed format that will be used at WF 2016

== Getting the feed ==

Connect to port 4713 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed.

Connect to port 4714 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you, with the exception that no judgement information will be sent for runs submitted during the last hour. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed (but you will still not get judgements for runs submitted the last hour).

== File format ==
The event feed is structured as an xml document within the root element <contest>.

All events are separate elements at the top level.

Some extra tags beyond what is documented here may also be sent, these should be ignored.

Event types are:

;info: contest information and updates
;language: submission language information
;region: super region information
;judgement: judgement information
;problem: problem information
;team: team information
;clar: submitted clarification information and updates
;run: submitted run information and updates
;testcase: judgement of individual test cases for a run

Most elements are identified by an id. Timestamped events all have a timestamp element in decimal seconds.
Submission events have a time element in decimal seconds relative to the contest start when it was submitted.

Events have time attributes identical to the timestamp element.

Sample events with inner element descriptions:
