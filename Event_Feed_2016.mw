This page describes the event feed format that will be used at WF 2016

== Getting the feed ==

Connect to port 4713 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed.

Connect to port 4714 and the entire feed for the contest will be sent to you, with the exception that no judgement information will be sent for runs submitted during the last hour. When the contest is finalized, the contest tag will be closed and the connection closed (but you will still not get judgements for runs submitted the last hour).

== File format ==
The event feed is structured as an xml document within the root element <contest>.

All events are separate elements at the top level. Elements are considered either ''static'' in which case only one such element occurs, or ''instances'' in which case different instances are distinguished by a unique id. When an element appears again in the feed, either static or an instance with the same id, it is considered to replace the previous occurence.

Some extra tags beyond what is documented here may also be sent, these should be ignored.

Event types are:

;info: contest information and updates (static)
;language: submission language information
;region: super region information (instance with id 'external-id')
;judgement: judgement information (instance with id 'acronym')
;problem: problem information
;team: team information
;clar: submitted clarification information and updates
;run: submitted run information and updates
;testcase: judgement of individual test cases for a run (instance identified by 'i' and 'judgement_id')
;finalized: contest finalization information (static)

If nothing is specified, elements are instances identified by an 'id'.

Time and timestamp elements are specified in seconds; time elements are in contest time (relative to contest start, corrected for removed time intervals) while timestamps are in Unix epoch. Both are specified with three decimal places, i.e. with millisecond resolution. Times are truncated, so in a 5 hour contest a submission at 18000 seconds is late.
Events have time and timestamp sub-elements that represent the same real moment in time.

Sample events with inner element descriptions:

=== <info> ===
