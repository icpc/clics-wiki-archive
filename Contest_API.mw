== Introduction ==

This page describes a '''draft''' API for accessing information provided by a [[Contest_Control_System|Contest Control System]] or [[CDS|Contest Data Server]].
Such an API can be used by a multitude of clients:
* an external scoreboard
* a scoreboard resolver application
* contest analysis software, such as the [[ICAT]] toolset
* another "shadow" CCS, providing run-forwarding together with the event feed
* internally, to interface between the CCS server and judging instances

This API is meant to be useful, not only at the ICPC World Finals, but more generally in any ICPC-style contest setup. It is meant to incorporate and supersede the [[JSON_Scoreboard_2016|JSON Scoreboard]], the [[Draft_2014_REST_interface_for_source_code_fetching|REST interface for source code fetching]], and the [[Contest_Start_Interface|Contest start interface]]. This REST interface is specified in conjuction with the new [[JSON Event Feed]], which provides all changes to this interface as CRUD-style events.

== General design principles ==

The interface is implemented as a HTTP REST interface that outputs information in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON JSON] format. The specific base URL will be dependent on the server (main CCS or CDS) providing the service; below we only indicate the relative paths of API endpoints. This REST interface should be provided over HTTPS to guard against eavesdropping on sensitive contest data and authentication credentials (see roles below).

We follow standard REST practices so that a whole collection can be requested, e.g. at the URL path
  GET https://example.com/api/teams
while an element with specific ID is requested as
  GET https://example.com/api/teams/10

A collection is always returned as a JSON list of objects. Every element represents a single element (and always includes the ID). When requesting a single element the exact same object is returned. E.g. the URL path
 GET baseurl/<collection>
returns
 [ { "id":<id1>, <element specific data for id2>},
   { "id":<id2>, <element specific data for id1>},
      ...
 ]
while the URL path
 GET baseurl/<collection>/<id1>
returns
 { "id":<id1>, <element specific data for id2>}

The standard HTTP verbs are used:
;GET
: Read data. This method is idempotent and does not modify any data. It can be used to request a whole collection or a specific element.
;POST
: Create a new element. This can only be called on a collection endpoint. No '''id''' attribute should be specified as it is up to the server to assign one, which is returned in the location header.
;PUT
: Replaces a specific element. This method is idempotent and can only be called on a specific element and replaces its contents with the data provided. The payload data should be complete, i.e. no partial updates are allowed. The '''id''' attribute cannot be changed: it does not need to be specified (other than in the URL) and if specified different from in the URL, a '''409 Conflict''' HTTP code should be returned.
;PATCH
: Updates/modifies a specific element. Similar to '''PUT''' but allows partial updates by providing only that data, for example:
: <code>PATCH https://example.com/api/teams/10</code>
: with JSON contents
: <code>{"name":"Our cool new team name"}</code>
: No updates of the '''id''' attribute are allowed either.
;DELETE (to be included)
: Delete a specific element. Idempotent, but may return a 404 status code when repeated. Any provided data is ignored. Example:
: <code>DELETE https://example.com/api/teams/8</code>
: Any deletes should always keep the referential integrity intact: at no time should an ID exist that refers to a deleted element. This can be ensured by either first deleting referenced elements (i.e. "ON DELETE CASCADE" in SQL terms) or setting the referencing ID to <tt>null</tt> (i.e. "ON DELETE SET NULL" in SQL terms) when this is allowed.

Standard [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes HTTP status codes] are returned to indicate success or failure.

=== Roles ===

Access to (specific parts of) the REST API is controlled via user roles. The provider should require HTTP authentication to access each role. This provides a standard and flexible method, while the user one authenticates as implies a role that can be used for fine-grained access control.

Each provider must support at least the following roles, although additional roles may be supported for specific uses:
* public (default role: contest data that's available to everyone)
* admin (data or capability only available to contest administrators)

Role-based access may completely hide some objects from the user, may omit certain attributes, or may embargo or omit objects based on the current contest time. 
By default, the public user has read-only access (no '''POST''', '''PUT''', '''PATCH''' or '''DELETE''' methods allowed) and does not have access to judgements and runs from submissions made after the contest freeze time.
'''TODO''': Details are listed for each object.

=== Recurring details ===

'''Absolute timestamps''' (type <tt>&lt;TIME&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are human-readable, given in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601] extended combined date/time format with timezone: <tt>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss(.uuu)?[+-]zz(:mm)?</tt> (or timezone <tt>Z</tt> for UTC).

'''Relative times''' (type <tt>&lt;RELTIME&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are human-readable, given in a slight modification of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601] extended time format: <tt>(-)?(h)*h:mm:ss(.uuu)?</tt>

'''Identifiers''' (type <tt>&lt;ID&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are given as string consisting of characters <tt>[a-zA-Z0-9-_]</tt> of length at most 36 and not starting with a <tt>-</tt> (dash).

Ids are assigned by the person or system that is the source of the object, and must be maintained by downstream systems. For example, the person configuring a contest on disk will typically define the id for each team, and any CCS or CDS that exposes the team must use the same id.

Some ids are also used as identifiable labels and are marked below along with the recommended format. These ids must be meaningful for human communication (e.g. team "43", problem "A") and are as short as reasonable but not more than 10. Ids not marked as labels may be random characters and cannot be assumed to be suitable for display purposes.

'''File''' content (type <tt>&lt;FILE&gt;</tt> in the specification) should be included within the JSON as a base64 encoded string when adding or updating an object. They are not included in the JSON in subsequent GET responses, but can be accessed via a corresponding child URL, e.g. teams/43/logo. Some servers may support content negotiation for different mime types.

'''Stream''' content (type <tt>&lt;STREAM&gt;</tt> in the specification) represent streaming content sources like live video. They are not included in JSON GET responses, but can be accessed via a corresponding child URL, e.g. teams/43/desktop will stream a team's desktop video. Some servers may support content negotiation for different mime types.

== Extensibility ==

This specification is meant to cover the basic data of a contest, with the idea that server/client implementations can extend this with more data and/or roles.
In particular, this specification already lists some endpoints or specific attributes as optional, or required only in ICPC World Finals context.
The following guidelines are meant to ease extensibility.

* Clients should accept extra attributes in endpoints, that are not specified here.
* Servers should not expect clients to recognize more than the basic, required specification.
* In this specification and extensions, an attribute with value <tt>null</tt> must be treated equivalently to that attribute not being present. Furthermore, we default to attributes not being present (instead of <tt>null</tt>).

== Interface specification ==

The following list of API endpoints are to be supported. Note that
<code>contest</code>, <code>scoreboard</code> and <code>event-feed</code> are singular nouns
and indeed contain only a single element.

All endpoints should support '''GET'''; specific details on other
methods are mentioned below.

The endpoints could be categorised into 3 groups as follows:

;Configuration: /, /languages, /problems, /teams, /organizations, /groups, /judgement-types
;Live data: /submissions, /judgements, /runs, /clarifications
;Aggregate data: /scoreboard, /event-feed

Configuration is normally set before contest start. Is not expected to, but could occasionally be updated during a contest. Does not have associated
timestamp/contest time attributes. Updates are notified via the event feed.

Live data is generated during the contest and new elements are expected. Data is immutable though, only inserts, no updates or deletes of elements. Does have associated
timestamp/contest time attributes. Inserts & deletes are notified via the event feed. '''Note''': judgements are the exception to immutability in a weak sense: they get updated once with the final verdict.

Aggregate data: Only GET makes sense. Not included in the event feed.

=== / ===

Provides information on the current contest.

On a system that supports multiple contests the '''baseurl''' could look something like <tt>basebaseurl/contests/<id></tt>, i.e. this endpoint is actually an element in the collection '''contests''' one level higher. On a system that does not support multiple contests the '''baseurl''' could look like <tt>basebaseurl/contest</tt>.

Returns a JSON object with the elements below. If there is no current (this may include about to start or just finished) contest, a 404 error is returned.

==== PATCH start_time ====

To replace the [[Contest Start Interface]], at the ICPC World Finals,
a CCS or CDS implementing this specification should allow for a specific role
('''FIXME''': define name later?) that has the ability to clear or set
the contest start time.

The PATCH must include a valid JSON element with only two attributes
allowed: the contest id (used for verification) and a start time (a
<code>&lt;TIME&gt;</code> value or <code>null</code>).

The request should fail with a 401 if the user does not have
sufficient access rights, or a 403 if the contest is started or within
30s of starting, or if the new start time is in the past or within 30s.
