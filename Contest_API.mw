== Introduction ==

This page describes a '''draft''' API for accessing information provided by a [[Contest_Control_System|Contest Control System]] or [[CDS|Contest Data Server]].
Such an API can be used by a multitude of clients:
* an external scoreboard
* a scoreboard resolver application
* contest analysis software, such as the [[ICAT]] toolset
* another "shadow" CCS, providing run-forwarding together with the event feed
* internally, to interface between the CCS server and judging instances

This API is meant to be useful, not only at the ICPC World Finals, but more generally in any ICPC-style contest setup. It is meant to incorporate and supersede the [[JSON_Scoreboard_2016|JSON Scoreboard]], the [[Draft_2014_REST_interface_for_source_code_fetching|REST interface for source code fetching]], and the [[Contest_Start_Interface|Contest start interface]]. This REST interface is specified in conjuction with a new [[#Event feed|NDJSON event feed]], which provides all changes to this interface as CRUD-style events.

== General design principles ==

The interface is implemented as a HTTP REST interface that outputs information in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON JSON] format. The specific base URL will be dependent on the server (main CCS or CDS) providing the service; below we only indicate the relative paths of API endpoints. This REST interface should be provided over HTTPS to guard against eavesdropping on sensitive contest data and authentication credentials (see roles below).

We follow standard REST practices so that a whole collection can be requested, e.g. at the URL path
  GET https://example.com/api/teams
while an element with specific ID is requested as
  GET https://example.com/api/teams/10

A collection is always returned as a JSON list of objects. Every element represents a single element (and always includes the ID). When requesting a single element the exact same object is returned. E.g. the URL path
 GET baseurl/<collection>
returns
 [ { "id":<id1>, <element specific data for id1>},
   { "id":<id2>, <element specific data for id2>},
      ...
 ]
while the URL path
 GET baseurl/<collection>/<id1>
returns
 { "id":<id1>, <element specific data for id1>}

=== HTTP methods ===

The current version of this specification only requires support for the '''GET''' method, unless explicitly specified otherwise in an endpoint below (see [[#PATCH_start_time|PATCH start_time]]).
However, for future compatibility below are already listed other methods with their expected behavior, if implemented.
;GET
: Read data. This method is idempotent and does not modify any data. It can be used to request a whole collection or a specific element.
;POST
: Create a new element. This can only be called on a collection endpoint. No '''id''' attribute should be specified as it is up to the server to assign one, which is returned in the location header.
;PUT
: Replaces a specific element. This method is idempotent and can only be called on a specific element and replaces its contents with the data provided. The payload data should be complete, i.e. no partial updates are allowed. The '''id''' attribute cannot be changed: it does not need to be specified (other than in the URL) and if specified different from in the URL, a '''409 Conflict''' HTTP code should be returned.
;PATCH
: Updates/modifies a specific element. Similar to '''PUT''' but allows partial updates by providing only that data, for example:
: <code>PATCH https://example.com/api/teams/10</code>
: with JSON contents
: <code>{"name":"Our cool new team name"}</code>
: No updates of the '''id''' attribute are allowed either.
;DELETE
: Delete a specific element. Idempotent, but may return a 404 status code when repeated. Any provided data is ignored. Example:
: <code>DELETE https://example.com/api/teams/8</code>
: Any deletes should always keep the referential integrity intact: at no time should an ID exist that refers to a deleted element. This can be ensured by either first deleting referenced elements (i.e. "ON DELETE CASCADE" in SQL terms) or setting the referencing ID to <tt>null</tt> (i.e. "ON DELETE SET NULL" in SQL terms) when this is allowed.

Standard [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes HTTP status codes] are returned to indicate success or failure.

=== Roles ===

Access to (specific parts of) the REST API is controlled via user roles. The provider should require HTTP authentication to access each role. This provides a standard and flexible method, while the user one authenticates as implies a role that can be used for fine-grained access control.

Each provider must support at least the following roles, although additional roles may be supported for specific uses:
* public (default role: contest data that's available to everyone)
* admin (data or capability only available to contest administrators)

Role-based access may completely hide some objects from the user, may omit certain attributes, or may embargo or omit objects based on the current contest time. 
By default, the public user has read-only access (no '''POST''', '''PUT''', '''PATCH''' or '''DELETE''' methods allowed) and does not have access to judgements and runs from submissions made after the contest freeze time.
'''TODO''': Details are listed for each object.

=== JSON attribute types ===

Attribute types are specified as one of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example standard JSON types], or one of the more specific types below.

;Absolute timestamps
: (type '''<tt>TIME</tt>''' in the specification) are human-readable, given in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601] extended combined date/time format with timezone: <tt>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss(.uuu)?[+-]zz(:mm)?</tt> (or timezone <tt>Z</tt> for UTC).
;Relative times
: (type '''<tt>RELTIME</tt>''' in the specification) are human-readable, given in a slight modification of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601] extended time format: <tt>(-)?(h)*h:mm:ss(.uuu)?</tt>
;Identifiers
: (type '''<tt>ID</tt>''' in the specification) are given as string consisting of characters <tt>[a-zA-Z0-9-_]</tt> of length at most 36 and not starting with a <tt>-</tt> (dash).
: IDs are assigned by the person or system that is the source of the object, and must be maintained by downstream systems. For example, the person configuring a contest on disk will typically define the ID for each team, and any CCS or CDS that exposes the team must use the same ID.
: Some IDs are also used as identifiable labels and are marked below along with the recommended format. These IDs should be meaningful for human communication (e.g. team "43", problem "A") and are as short as reasonable but not more than 10 characters. IDs not marked as labels may be random characters and cannot be assumed to be suitable for display purposes.
;Ordinals
: (type '''<tt>ORDINAL</tt>''' in the specification) are used to give an explicit order to a list of objects. Ordinal attributes are integers and must be non-negative and unique in a list of objects, and they should typically be low numbers starting from zero. However, clients must not assume that the ordinals start at zero nor that they are sequential. Instead the ordinal values should be used to sort the list of objects.

Besides the normal attributes, there are also endpoints that provide files or streams, such as <tt>/organizations/inst-123/logo</tt>, <tt>/submissions/526/files</tt> or <tt>/teams/42/webcam</tt>. In this case the server must provide the appropriate mime type and may support content negotiation for different mime types. Support to upload such files, if implemented by the server, should be done by accepting in a POST, PUT or PATCH to the parent collection or element endpoint an extra attribute with the same name and with value a base64 encoded string of the associated file contents. For example
    POST https://example.com/api/organizations
with JSON data
    { "id":"inst105",
      "name":"Carnegie Mellon University",
      ...
      "logo":"&lt;base64 string&gt;"
    }

== Extensibility ==

This specification is meant to cover the basic data of a contest, with the idea that server/client implementations can extend this with more data and/or roles.
In particular, this specification already lists some endpoints or specific attributes as optional, or required only in ICPC World Finals context.
The following guidelines are meant to ease extensibility.

* Clients should accept extra attributes in endpoints, that are not specified here.
* Servers should not expect clients to recognize more than the basic, required specification.
* In this specification and extensions, an attribute with value <tt>null</tt> may be left out by the server (i.e. not be present). A client must treat an attribute with value <tt>null</tt> equivalently as that attribute not being present.

== Interface specification ==

The following list of API endpoints are to be supported. Note that
<code>contest</code>, <code>scoreboard</code> and <code>event-feed</code> are singular nouns
and indeed contain only a single element.

All endpoints should support '''GET'''; specific details on other
methods are mentioned below.

The endpoints could be categorised into 3 groups as follows:

;Configuration: /, /languages, /problems, /teams, /organizations, /groups, /judgement-types
;Live data: /submissions, /judgements, /runs, /clarifications, /awards
;Aggregate data: /scoreboard, /event-feed

Configuration is normally set before contest start. Is not expected to, but could occasionally be updated during a contest. It does not have associated
timestamp/contest time attributes. Updates are notified via the event feed.

Live data is generated during the contest and new elements are expected. Data is immutable though, only inserts, no updates or deletes of elements. It does have associated
timestamp/contest time attributes. Inserts and deletes are notified via the event feed. '''Note''': judgements are the exception to immutability in a weak sense: they get updated once with the final verdict.

Aggregate data: Only '''GET''' makes sense. These are not included in the event feed.

In the tables below, the columns are:
;Name: Attribute name; object sub-attributes are indicated as <tt>object.attribute</tt>.
;Type: Data type of the attribute; either a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example JSON type] or [[Draft_CCS_REST_interface#Recurring_details|a type defined above]].
;Required?: Whether this is a required attribute that '''must''' be implemented to conform to this specification.
;Nullable?: Whether the attribute might be <tt>null</tt> (and thus implicitly can also not be present in that case).
;Source @WF: Specifies whether this attribute is implemented at the ICPC World Finals and by whom.
;Description: Description of the meaning of the attribute and any special considerations.

Note that if an attribute is required and nullable, then if in a particular instance it is <tt>null</tt>, it may be left out. On the other hand, an attribute that is optional, but not nullable must either always be present (if the server implements/uses it), or never be present (if the server does not implement/use it). If an attribute is not implemented by a server, then it must never be present; this means that if a client sees an attribute, this means that the server implements it.


=== Contests ===

Provides information on the current contest.

The following endpoint is associated with contest:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Endpoint
! Mime-type
! Required?
! Source @WF

On a system that supports multiple contests the '''baseurl''' could look something like <tt>basebaseurl/contests/<id></tt>, i.e. this endpoint is actually an element in the collection '''contests''' one level higher. On a system that does not support multiple contests the '''baseurl''' could look like <tt>basebaseurl/contest</tt>.

Returns a JSON object with the elements below. If there is no current (this may include about to start or just finished) contest, a 404 error is returned.

==== Access restrictions at WF ====

No access restrictions apply to a GET on this endpoint.

==== PATCH start_time ====

To replace the [[Contest Start Interface]], at the ICPC World Finals,
a provided by CCS or CDS implementing this specification should allow for a specific role
('''FIXME''': define name later?) that has the ability to clear or set
the contest start time.

The PATCH must include a valid JSON element with only two attributes
allowed: the contest id (used for verification) and a start time (a
<code>&lt;TIME&gt;</code> value or <code>null</code>).

The request should fail with a 401 if the user does not have
sufficient access rights, or a 403 if the contest is started or within
30s of starting, or if the new start time is in the past or within 30s.

|-
| team_ids

| no
| CDS
| JSON array of team ids receiving this award
|}

==== Access restrictions at WF ====

For clients with the '''public''' role, awards will not include information from judgements of submissions received after the scoreboard freeze until it has been unfrozen.

==== Semantics ====

* Awards are not final until the contest is.
* If an award is not intended to be updated during the contest it should not be present during the contest. E.g. if "winner" will not be updated with the current leader during the contest, it should not be '''create'''d until the award '''is''' awarded. 
* If an award is present during the contest this means that if the contest would end immediately and then become final, that award would be final. E.g. the "winner" during the contest should be the current leader. This is of course subject to what data the client can see; the public role's winner may not change during the scoreboard freeze but an admin could see the true current winner.
* If it's not possible to yet determine how the award would end up if the contest would end immediately, it must not be set. E.g. there should be no team ID for the "first-to-solve-a" award if there are still submissions without a judgement on problem A that are earlier than all accepted submissions on problem A.

For some common award cases the following IDs should be used. 
{| class="wikitable"
! ID

! Meaning when contest is final

=== Event feed ===

Provides the event feed for the current contest. This is effectively a changelog of create, update and delete events taking place in the REST endpoints.

Since this is generated data, only the '''GET''' method is allowed here, irrespective of role.

The following endpoint is associated with event feed:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Endpoint
! Mime-type
! Required?
! Source @WF
! Description
|-
| /event-feed
| application/x-ndjson
| yes
| CCS
| NDJSON feed of events as defined below
|}

Multiple requests of the event feed must return the exact same events in the exact same order, except that events filtered out by the feed options must be left out and possible new elements are added in later requests.

To ensure keep alive, if no event is sent in 120 seconds, a newline must be sent.

==== Feed options ====

There are options for filtering based on events and starting the feed at a specified event. Any combination of these may be specified.

===== Filtering events =====

If a client only wants some types of events the feed can be filtered with the "type" URL argument:

 /event-feed?type=submissions,teams

If not specified all events will be sent. If specified only events of the listed type will be sent.

===== Feed starting point =====

If a client wants data from some point in time this can be done with the "id" URL argument:

 /event-feed?id=dj593

If specified the event feed will include all events strictly ''after'' the specified id. If a client copies the id of an event and uses that for the id URL argument it will get all events after that event. This is useful e.g. if a client is disconnected and wants to continue where it left off.

If the id is not specified or invalid the event feed will include all events from the beginning of the feed.

==== Feed format ====

The feed is served as [http://specs.okfnlabs.org/ndjson/ Newline delimited JSON], with every event as its own JSON object. 

This document uses the term "element". An element corresponds to a single object (run, judgement, language, team, etc.).

The general format for events is:
  {id": "<id>", "type": "<event type>", "op": "<type of operation>", "data": <JSON data for element> }

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name

==== General access restrictions ====

No access restrictions apply to a GET on this endpoint.

However, the response and '''data''' objects contained in it must observe the same restrictions as those of the respective endpoints.
This means that attributes inside the '''data''' element will be present if and only if the client has access to those at the respective endpoint, and receives create, update and delete events only of elements it has (partial) access to, and create or delete events for elements when time-based access is granted or revoked.

==== Example ====

Request:
  GET https://example.com/api/event-feed
Returned data:
  {"type":"teams","id":"k-2435","op":"create","data":{"id":"11","icpc_id":"201433","name":"Shanghai Tigers","organization_id":"inst123","group_id":"asia"}}
  {"type":"teams","id":"k-2436","op":"update","data":{"id":"11","icpc_id":"201433","name":"The Shanghai Tigers","organization_id":"inst123","group_id":"asia"}}
  {"type":"teams","id":"k-2437","op":"delete","data":{"id":"11"}}
