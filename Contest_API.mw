== Introduction ==

This page describes a '''draft''' API for accessing information provided by a [[Contest_Control_System|Contest Control System]] or [[CDS|Contest Data Server]].
Such an API can be used by a multitude of clients:
* an external scoreboard
* a scoreboard resolver application
* contest analysis software, such as the [[ICAT]] toolset
* another "shadow" CCS, providing run-forwarding together with the event feed
* internally, to interface between the CCS server and judging instances

This API is meant to be useful, not only at the ICPC World Finals, but more generally in any ICPC-style contest setup. It is meant to incorporate and supersede the [[JSON_Scoreboard_2016|JSON Scoreboard]] and [[Draft_2014_REST_interface_for_source_code_fetching|REST interface for source code fetching]].

== General design principles ==

The interface is implemented as a HTTP REST interface that outputs information in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON JSON] format. The specific base URL will be dependent on the server (main CCS or CDS) providing the service and will be indicated as <tt>baseurl</tt>.
The design is based on the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RVKS_u36WY9kU8iVIMzHtH5Df3WjK-mt-YmJu8j6ZI/edit ICPC Contest Ontology draft].

We follow standard REST practices so that a whole collection can be requested, e.g. at the URL path
  GET http://example.com/teams
while an element with specific ID is requested as
  GET http://example.com/teams/10
Querying on any other attributes than main ID is done through a URL argument "filter":
  http://example.com/teams?filter=group_id:7

Besides '''GET''', also '''POST''', '''PUT''', and '''DELETE''' methods are available to update states (with sufficient permissions). Standard HTTP error codes are returned to indicate success or failure.

Access to (parts of) the API is optionally controlled by HTTP authentication. This provides a standard and flexible method, while the user one authenticates as can be used for fine-grained access control to specific bits.

=== Recurring details ===

'''Absolute timestamps''' (type <tt>&lt;TIME&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are human-readable, given in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601] extended combined date/time format with timezone: <tt>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss(.uuu)?[+-]zz(:mm)?</tt> (or timezone <tt>Z</tt> for UTC).

'''Relative times''' (type <tt>&lt;RELTIME&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are human-readable, given in a slight modification of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601] extended time format: <tt>(-)?(h)*h:mm:ss(.uuu)?</tt>

'''Identifiers''' (type <tt>&lt;ID&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are given as string consisting of characters <tt>[a-zA-Z0-9-_]</tt> of length at most 36 and not starting with a <tt>-</tt> (dash).

'''Labels''' (type <tt>&lt;LABEL&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are strings consisting of characters <tt>[a-zA-Z0-9-_]</tt> of length at most 10 and not starting with a <tt>-</tt> (dash).
The rationale is that these characters are both URL and filename safe, and the length is small enough to make these easy to use for human communication.
If an element has both an identifier and a label, then the intention is that the label can be identical to the identifier if it is short enough.

'''File contents''' (type <tt>&lt;FILE&gt;</tt> in the specification)
are given as base64 encoded string.
'''TODO''': also support a download URL?

== Interface specification ==

The following list of API calls are to be supported; <tt>baseurl</tt> denotes an HTTP or HTTPS URL at which this API is provided.
