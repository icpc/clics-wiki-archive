A Test Harness is an automated testing framework.

This article contains information about the input, output and tests for
systems implementing the [[CCS]]

'''Comment''' This needs to be split into two articles, keep requirements in this one, and move other information to another article [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 17:47, 17 April 2011 (CEST)

==Testing [[Contest_Control_System#Prohibited_Operations|Prohibited Operations]]==

In order to test each of the Prohibited Operation a set of standardized messages
needs to be defined.

{| class="wikitable"
! Operation 
! Expected Message
|-
| Using libraries except those explicitly allowed || Team's program used unauthorized library/function
|-
| Executing other programs || Team's program executed program "/bin/perl"
|-
| Creating new processes || Team's program tried to start new process
|-
| Creating new threads || Team's program attempted to create a thread
|-
| Reading any files  || Team's program tried to read file "c.in"
|-
| Creating files || Team's program tried to create file "c.in"
|-
| Sending signals to other programs || Team's program tried to use a signal N
|-
| Side-stepping time or memory limits || Team's program attempted to exceed limit <br> Team's program attempted to exceed memory limit
|-
| Sending or receiving network traffic ||  Team's program tried to write network output <br> Team's program tried to read network input
|}

==Testing [[Contest_Control_System#Validators|Validators]]==

Per the [[Output validator]] article test validators to report proper results, esp. file format.

:'''Comment''' TODO complete writing this section [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 23:31, 28 February 2011 (CET)
