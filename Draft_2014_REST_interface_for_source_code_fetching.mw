== Introduction ==

This page describes a '''draft''' interface for fetching contestants' source code, and is intented to be used by e.g. shadow CCS's to obtain a complete state from the main [[Contest_Control_System|CCS]], possibly through a [[CDS|Contest Data Server]].

== General design principles ==

The interface is implemented as a HTTP REST interface that outputs information in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON JSON] format. The specific base URL will be dependent on the server (main CCS or CDS) providing the service and will be indicated as <tt>baseurl</tt>.

Query parameters are passed as variables in the URL instead of encoded in the URL path, e.g.
  GET http://example.com/team?id=10
instead of
  GET http://example.com/team/10

Rationale: this allows for more flexibility to later extend/generalize the interface, e.g. to return results depending on a filter:
  http://example.com/team?group=europe


== Interface specification ==

=== GET baseurl/submission_files ===

This provides the file(s) of a specific submission.

Parameters:
* '''id''' required identifier of the submission

Returns a JSON array, with each element an object describing a file, with the following elements:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name
! Type
! Description
|-
| filename
| string
| filename of this file (without path? any disallowed characters?)
|-
| content
| string
| base64 encoded contents of the file
|}

'''To be added''': how to encode encode for Java submissions which file contains the main class, and/or what the main class name is?

==== Example ====

Request:
  GET http://example.com/submission_files?id=223
Returned data:
  [{"filename":"a.java","content":"&lt;base64_string&gt;"}]
