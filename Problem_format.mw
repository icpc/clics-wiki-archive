All files related to a given problem lie in one directory and its
subdirectories. The name of the directory is also the short-name or
identifier for the problem.

"ignore_space_change" - only cares if there is *some* whitespace, ignores amount and type of whitespace<br>

===Sample problem.cfg===
 
As an standard .ini file blank lines and lines starting with # will be ignored

 name = Squares to Circles
 short_name = squares
 source = ICPC Mid-Atlantic Regional Contest
 author = Judge X
 # license  optional, defaults to "cc by-sa"  
 rights_owner = ICPC
 time_limit_multiplier=5
 time_limit_safety-margin=10
 # memory_limit  optional, defaults to 2GB  
 # output_limit  optional, defaults to 8MB  
 validator = ignore_space_change float_absolute_tolerance 0.001
 # validator = custom --limits 3,8,44 --haltfirst

=== problem.tex ===

Latex file that only includes the problem text itself, including input
and output specifications, but not sample input and output. A template
will be provided that \imports this file as well as the sample input
and output. Files needed by this file must all be in
<problem>/problem_statement/ , problem.tex should include auxiliary files as if
working directory is <problem>/problem_statement/ .

=== <short-name>/data/*/* ===

All input and answer files must have the filename extension .in and
.ans respectively. Optionally a text file describing the purpose of an
input file may be present. Input, answer and description files are
matched by the base name.

=== <short-name>/test_submissions/*/ ===

Every file or directory in these directories represent a separate
solution. Same requirements as for submissions with regards to
filenames. subdirectories that would be empty can be left out.

=== <short-name>/*_validators/ ===

Every file or directory in these directories represent a separate
validator. A validator in the form of a directory may include a
makefile, if so it will be used. If not, the validator will be
compiled as if it was a solution. Input and output validators must
adhere to the input and output validator standard respectively.

:'''Comment:''' Can the validator be an executable or a shell/perl/etc. script ? [[User:Douglas Lane|Douglas Lane]] 20:44, 16 February 2011 (CET)

=== Verification ===

Solutions or validators in languages that is not supported by the CCS
should be ignored and a warning to that effect shown.

 Warn if:
       there is no problem.tex
       there are no *.in in data/sample/

 Error if:
       there is no problem.cfg
       any value in problem.cfg is invalid
       there are no *.in in data/secret/
       there are .in files without corresponding .ans files in data/*/
       there are no solutions in test_submissions/accepted/
       there are no validators in input_validators/
       validator begins with "custom" and there are no validators in output_validators/

 For each *.in in public_data and judge_data:
       For each validator in input_validators/:
               If the validator does not accept the input file: Error!

 For each solution in test_submissions/accepted/:
       For each *.in in data/*/:
               Run the solution on the input
               For the built-in validator if corrector is "diff" or each validator in output_validators/:
                       If the validator does not accept the output of the solution: Error!
 Let t be the longest time any of the solutions ran on any of the inputs.

 For each solution in test_submissions/time_limit_exceeded/:
       For each *.in in data/*/:
               Run the solution on the input for at least t * time_limit_safety_margin seconds.
 Let t_slow be the shortest time any of the solutions ran on any of the inputs.

 If t_slow is less than t * time_limit_safety_margin: Error!

 The execution time limit should be at least t * time_limit_multiplier and at most 1 second more.

 For each solution in test_submissions/wrong_answer/:
       For each *.in in data/*/:
               Run the solution on the input
               For the built-in validator if corrector = "diff" or each validator in output_validators/:
                       If the validator accepts the output of the solution: Error!

 For each solution in test_submissions/run_time_error/:
       For each *.in in data/*/:
               Run the solution on the input
               If the solution is not judged Run-Time Error: Error!
