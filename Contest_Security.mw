= Contest Security =

This document is a first pass (draft!) at documenting ICPC contest security: who should have access to what information (data), and when.

== Terms ==

 - Contest freeze is the time (typically 1h before the end of a contest) after which the contest scoreboard is frozen and submission judgments are no longer public.

== Roles ==

To keep things simple, access to contest information is provided via roles. Each person (user id) is granted access by being associated with one or more roles. The roles are:

 - Blue - Access to all information inside the blue network: videos, submissions, etc. from all teams, even after contest freeze.
 - Green - What a person could see onsite at the finals
 - Public - Unsecured information with full public access. Potentially available via http over the internet.
