== Introduction ==

The Contest Data Server (or CDS) is a single place for clients of any kind to request contest data via URL. This document contains information on what services (URLs) are available from the CDS, what content is returned, and links to specs for the format of some files.

Internally, the CDS may be implemented using multiple servers, pull data from the contest control system or other servers, or even aggregate. From a client perspective the important thing is that ''none of this matters'': the CDS is a one-stop shop for all contest information. Clients only need to know how to connect to URLs.

Notes:
* URLs below are in the format "http://cds/xyz". The exact hostname or IP address for 'cds' each year will be provided once the network is setup onsite.
* Some of the URL contain a year (e.g. http://cds/2014/xyz") to indicate that these are temporary formats that may change over the coming year.

== Access & Authentication ==

Requests for access to the CDS must be made through the world finals technical director (John Clevenger) and must include information on contact who will be onsite at the finals. Many of the services will contain non-public information, so each client will be given a unique user id & password and must connect to the CDS over HTTPS. (HTTP access will be redirected)

To simplify access rules, there are three main zones that will have access to different content:

* Blue = The contest network. Clients on this network have unrestricted access to all services.
* Green = The onsite contest.
* Public = The public internet.
